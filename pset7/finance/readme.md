### Finance Task

Was tasked with finishing the implentation of the front and back end of C$50 Finance, a stock portfolio trading site.

helpers.py, layout.html, login.html, the login route for application.py, the non-table areas of
static.css and requirements.txt were provided by Harvard CS50.

Everything else was implemented by me.
